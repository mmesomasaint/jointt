# Jointt
### An Online Event Handling Workshop for seamless kick-start of any & every events.

## Built with firebase auth, firebase firestore, Nextjs and Tailwind

An untrained event planner can oragnise a team of contractors to make an event successful.
This project is basically about easing the finding of contractors by someone who doesnt or hasn't ever organized an event in their career.

## HowIt Works 

All you have t do is create an event, describing the `Name`, `Type` and `Size` or `Budget` of the event and automatic sugestions of contractors with diverse specifications with the various infrastructure and tips to run a successful event.
You can also easily reject the suggestions and select or invite your contractors your self, also hire your location.

## Parties Involved 

The Event
The Contractor 
The Host
The Jobs
The Contract
The Proposal

#### To Explain:
The `Host` creates an `Event` with lots of `Jobs` listed or sent as invites to some specified contractors selected by the `Host` or suggested automatically.
The `Contractor` either accepts the invite or send a `Proposal` to a `Job` listing. 
When a `Proposal` is accepted by the `Host` or a `Job` invite is accepted by a `Contractor`. Then a `Contract` is created and issued to them both to make ajustments based on job or agreement which get into registra until the work is done and the work and pay released to both parties.

## Motivations

I have that one friend who knows who to go to or refer you to for every or any issue whatsoever. I built this software with hope that it could be that person for others. You don't need to even be a tech savy to use the site. Thanks to our UX Engineer (Me!) for the great UI.
And also to link the best skills to the best offers out there irrespective of the parties location.
